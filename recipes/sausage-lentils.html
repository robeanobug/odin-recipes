    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is a great recipe to make if you want to make something super delicious on a budget. Lentils are a historically inexpensive, convenient and nutritious food due to how long they are easily stored and kept for long periods of time while equally providing much needed calories for people that are poverty stricken. I love this recipe because it is so easy to make, cheap, and such a warm comforting meal. I also personally love to eat this meal with some fresh bread from a local bakery.</p>
